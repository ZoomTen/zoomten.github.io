				<h2>You can optimize it later</h2>
				<p>
					How many people you think have done
					exactly that, huh? You'd think this
					would be a no-brainer. But no.
					We still have dozens of classes on
					every element with the same 5 MB
					CSS framework. Do you know
					why?

				<span class="marquee-container">

						BECAUSE <strong>NO ONE DOES THAT!</strong>
					</span>
				</span>

					Because why in the right mind would
					you want to fix something that isn't
					broken? You're on a tight schedule, anyway.
					So ship it as-is!
